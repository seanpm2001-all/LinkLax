LinkLax - Concept

Browser extension, Program extension

Change the default color of links

- Depending on language
- All

http - Default=red (To warn the user that the site does not have a secure connection)
https - Default=green (To tell the user that the site has a secure connection)
en - Default=Blue (I don't know what to default this to)
ru - Default=Turquiose (I don't know what to default this to)
ja - Default=White with red in the middle or in the a (To resemble the flag of Japan)
zh - Default=Red (I don't know what to default this to)
ko - Default=Blue (I don't know what to default this to)
haw - Default=Yellow (For the sand on the beaches of Hawaii)
de - Default=Black (For the top of the German flag)
eo - Default=White or Black (depending on dark/light mode preference, as these are the universal and default colors in the color spectrum, and Esperanto is designed to be a universal language.)
es - Default=White (I don't know what to default this to)
ar - Default=Green (The color of the flag of Saudi Arabia)
se - Default=Blue (The main color of the Swedish flag)
uk - Default=White (I don't know what to default this to)
www - Default=blue (For the main color that makes up the world)
file:/// Default=orange (For the color of an orange folder)
.us - Default=Red, White, and Blue (For the colors of the flag of the United States of America)
.uk - Default=Red, Blue, and white (For the colors of the British flag, reversed a bit to make it not exactly the same as the US flag)
.ru - Default=White, blue, and red (For the colors of the modern Russian flag)
.eu - Default=Blue, and yellow (For the colors of the European Union's flag)
.com - Default=silver (I don't know what to default this to
.org - Default=Navy (For the color I think of when I see/hear ".org")
.net - Default=Cyan (For the color of a server light)
.gov - Default=White (I don't know what to default this to)
.io - Default=White (I don't know what to default this to)
.gg - Default-Purple (To match the color of Discord)
.su - Default=Red (To match the colors of the Soviet Union, if you were to even find a site with the .su domain)

I originally planned for this to be a program language, but that was scrapped within the first minute of idea development. Making LinkLax a programming language would be way too much and completely unnecessary.

Updates will be labeled as such:

H0.x = Alpha releases
H1.x = Beta releases
H2.0.x = Full releases

Codename: Hyperwater (HyperH2.0) not an O, hyper water is different from Earth water
